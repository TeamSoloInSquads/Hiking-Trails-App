# Hiking-Trails-App

Milestone 1: Proposal 

Hiking Trails App will be an application designed to let the user know what hiking trails or great views are around based on the users current location. The user will also be able uploads photos of the hike or view so that the next time someone looks up that hiking trail they will be able to see thier photos. 

Must have features: 
  * Display hiking trails that are closest to the user
  * Upload photos to the database based on location in correlation with the hiking trail
  * Map-like feature that displays the hiking trails on the map
  
Nice to have features:
  * Review sections so other people can see what people thought about the trails
  * Database that updates automatically to everyones app, so when someone uploads a photo everyone can see it. 
  
  
  
I will be working on this alone, so I will be doing all the work. 
My code review partner will be Betty Reaney.
